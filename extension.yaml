      What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2.
      Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random,

      We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

  - param: TOP_P
    label: Nucleus Sampling Probability
    description: >-
      An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, 
      where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
      So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
      We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.
